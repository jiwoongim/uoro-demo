To set up this repo, go:

```
git clone https://github.com/petered/uoro-demo.git
cd uoro-demo
source setup.sh
```
(You'll be prompted to setup pytorch manually depending on your system).

Or to be able to import this code in an existing Python environment, go:

```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/petered/uoro-demo.git#egg=uoro-demo
```

You'll need the artemis dependency to be checked out on branch ("peter") for now.
