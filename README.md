# uoro-demo (works on GPU)

A PyTorch implementation of [Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05043); Corentin Tallec, Yann Ollivier.

The main file to run is `demo_uoro/demo_uoro_anbn.py`.  This compares UORO and RTRL on the a^n b^n dataset.

To set up this repo, go:

```
git clone https://github.com/petered/uoro-demo.git
cd uoro-demo
source setup.sh
```
(You'll be prompted to setup pytorch manually depending on your system).

You'll need the artemis dependency to be checked out on branch ("peter") for now.
